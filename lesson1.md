# Lesson 1

## Sociocultural history of obesidy
- food industry after WWII change the food intaken pattern
- **convenient food** generally have higher energy than home cooked food
- corn syrup make food not only tastes good but also **extend shelf life**

## Macronutrient Structure & Metabolism
- live 3 mins without O_2, 3 days without water, 3 weeks without food (seriously?)
- 3 macronutrients: carbohydrates, protein, fat
- focusing on nutrients instead of food can be confusing
- in each category, choose the ones *supporting* health instead of working against it

### carbohydrates
- mono, di, poly saccarides
- fibers are indigestable polysaccarides (e.g. cellulose )

### protein
- lean tissues

### fat
- stored in adipose tissue
- highest energy density (9 Cal/g), alcohol 7 Cal/g, carb and pro 4 Cal/g
