# Lesson 1

## Sociocultural history of obesidy
- food industry after WWII change the food intaken pattern
- **convenient food** generally have higher energy than home cooked food
- corn syrup make food not only tastes good but also **extend shelf life**

## Macronutrient Structure & Metabolism
- live 3 mins without O<sub>2</sub>, 3 days without water, 3 weeks without food (seriously?)
- 3 macronutrients: carbohydrates, protein, fat
- focusing on nutrients instead of food can be confusing
- in each category, choose the ones *supporting* health instead of working against it

### carbohydrates
- mono, di, poly saccarides
- fibers are indigestable polysaccarides (e.g. cellulose )

### protein
- lean tissues

### fat
- stored in adipose tissue
- highest energy density (9 Cal/g), alcohol 7 Cal/g, carb and pro 4 Cal/g

## Carbohydrate-rich Foods & the Glycemic Index
- focusing on foods instead of nutrients
- bad example for focusing on nutrients: cut down carbohydrtes
- Glycemic index (GI): measure the speed of raising blood sugar
- good carbs have lower GI, release sugar gradually, need smaller amount of insulin
- bad carbs (finer) have higher GI, raise blood sugar quickly, need high insulin level, disturb the balance

## Animal & Plant-based Proteins
- 20 amino acids (AA), 9 of them **essential** (cannot be made by ourselves)
- most animal-based protein provide all the essential AA, referred as complete 
- plant-based proteins not complete, but can be combined to complete
- plant-based lower fat sepecially saturated fat
- more animal than need, low quality ,sodium and nitrite

## Dietary Fats & Their Effects on Human Health
- human body cannot make all the necessary fatty acids, like omega-3 unsaturated
- artificial unsaturated fatty acids are not stable, the *cis* double bond can be changed to *trans* —— “**trans fat**”
- trans fat reduces HDL(good ones) and increases LDL(bad ones), natural saturated fat increases LDL
- generally, avoid trans fat, eat more natural unsat fat and eat less sat fat
